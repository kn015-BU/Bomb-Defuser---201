## How to Play

    Four buttons with numbers 1 to 4 are displayed at the bottom of the screen.
    The passcode to defuse the bomb is randomized each time the game starts.
    Click on the buttons to enter the passcode.
    If the entered passcode matches the randomized passcode, the bomb is defused.
    If the passcode is incorrect, an explosion animation is displayed, and the game ends.
